# time-series-analyses-and-climate-change
Ties together the notebooks and data pertaining to a blog post on medium - the blog post focusses on some fundamentals of time series analyses. 

You may read the wrangled/processed data directly with Pandas, or go through the exercise from scratch using the raw data.

The raw data can either be downloaded with this repo or from NASA and the World Bank respectively:

- https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/GLB.Ts+dSST.csv
- http://api.worldbank.org/v2/en/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.PC?downloadformat=csv

Posts on Dynamic Time Warping as well as Granger Causality (with this data) will be available soon. 

A post on using ARIMA will also be available in the future.
